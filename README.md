# Revisions and the Cloud

## Seeing Your Remote


By running the git remote command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.

By using git remote -v, you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.

$ cd example

$ git remote -v

## Adding Remotes
To create a new remote Git repository with a short name, use the following format:

git remote add shortname url
